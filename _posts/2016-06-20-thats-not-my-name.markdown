title: Naming Things is Hard

There is a [pretty common joke][0] that goes around in CS circles.

Though looking at that quote, it's not really a joke...  
I laugh every time it's told?  
programming is weird....  

Anyways... I always hated my birth name.  

It's a pretty common trans narrative.  
Names get tied to genders and become symbols of bodies,  
bodies that develop in ways we can't control but know are wrong.

For most transwomen, birth names seem uncontrollable for far longer than bodies.  
For example, long after I was able to "pass" just based on how I looked,  
showing my ID instantly outed me.  

The simple case is a bar, I hated it when bartenders would give me looks of distrust after seeing my years old ID.  
But legal name troubles extend far beyond strange looks in bars.

### Choosing a Name ###

My name is Katherine.  
Except most of the time it's Bryce.

I had a coworker apologize to me the other day when he found out that my legal name was Katherine;  
He thought he had been calling me by my $DEAD_NAME the whole time he knew me.  
Apparently Bryce sounds like a guy's name.  

$DEAD_NAME?  
It's a term transwomen in tech use to refer to our birth names.  
Apparently only unix users can be trans.

It's a little silly how names have gendered expectations.   
Sally, Sal. Mark, Mary. John, Joan. etc...  
I never really thought about my birth name until I started coming to terms with having a different than expected body.  
My mother told me that she had considered the name Brice, and I quickly became partial to it.  
It seemed softer, less masculine, more me. I gave serious consideration to changing my name to it in High School.

When I finally stopped lying to myself and came out as trans I immediately knew what name I wanted.  
Some quick googling confirmed that, indeed there was a semi-famous ~~vampire~~ woman with the name Bryce.   
I was set.

Legal names are strange things.  
If you have a Robert that introduces themselves as Bob no one bats an eye.  
If you have a Steve that introduces themselves as Sandra mostly no one bats an eye.  

The big difference comes in situations where you bump up against bureaucracies.  
Situations involving social security numbers, or financial accounts, or driver's licenses.  
It's almost impossible to navigate these situations using a pseudonym.  

Though it's actually simple, right?  
Just change your name legally.  
In Illinois that means $500 and two days in Daley Center, but it's not actually that bad.  

Except.  
Many interactions and plenty of informal polling revealed that most people see Bryce as an exclusively male name.  
Not that I really mind? I mean if I like a name I like a name.  
Honestly the androgyny is probably a big part of what draws me to it.  
But it does make certain situations awkward, especially as my presentation is still in flux.  

Job interviews, doctor appointments, bars, banks, rental markets.  
These are all places where having a clear female name helps my presentation and ensures I'm gendered correctly.  
And it isn't like I have these sorts of encounters on a regular basis.  

So I got my name legally changed to Katherine. Kind of like a reverse $DEAD_NAME.  
But I prefer to go by Bryce among friends and family.

### Cache Invalidation ###

Apparently names are not meant to be changed.  

They are a prime candidate to be "cached" or "indexed" and used as an immutable "primary key" for a person.  
Except when they aren't.  

Clearly, this isn't one to one with CS cache invalidation problems.  
But there still is the question of 

> "How do I trigger invalidations and how do I handle partial invalidations?"

It would be pretty easy to go scorched earth. Start over with a cold cache.  
Close all my financial accounts, sign up as a new person for utilities, change doctors/insurance/pharmacies.  
Obviously this is a subpar strategy... 

So I've begun the slow process of calling/faxing(!)/emailing a million faceless corporations.   
All basically to save a credit score.  

Facebook is a different part of this process. (I'm assuming you came here from Facebook...)  
While it is "private", it is also a very public service.  
I doubt it would be possible to go into a job interview or on a first date where my page hasn't been looked up.  
It's different than my github/twitter/domain in that my username and display name one in the same.  
Honestly, given the number of Facebook logins available it almost feels like Facebook is your driver's license online.

And while Facebook is the clearest case for using my legal name online it certainly isn't the only one.  
Though I haven't really decided what else I'll be changing.  
(github pages doesn't make it any easier since you can only have one CNAME entry...)
