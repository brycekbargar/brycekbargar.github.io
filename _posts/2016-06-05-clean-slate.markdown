title: The Simplest Thing (that could possibly work)
category: blog
---

So I've had this site for little over a year.  
One year.  
No one starts a blog with the intention to write 4 posts, [all aplogizing for not blogging more][0].  
That's kind of what I ended up with.

So.  
Rather than just continue with what was obviously not working,  
I made a couple of changes to how I approach this site.

<!--more-->

#### Moving to Jekyll ####

My site was originally hosted and built with SquareSpace.  
Mostly because Roman Mars told me to.  
But I guess, also a little because I just wanted **[The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work][1]**.

Obviously it wasn't working.  
Slightly less obvious is that it wasn't simple.

Editing text in a web browser is like heating a can of soup with a cigarette lighter.  
[I realllly hate saving files locally][2].  
When you combine these two things it leads to a lot of lost drafts and never started posts. 

Modifying SquareSpace themes is simple, in theory.  
In practice I never cared enough to slog throught 1000's of lines of css and arbitrary classes to fix what I disliked.

Jekyll is different.  
Everything is in a repo and I can write posts in neovim like it's properly 2016.  
Simple. Works.  
I've stripped the whole site to barely functional html + [vanilla cutestrap][3] + 15 lines of barely functional css.  
Simple. Works.

Seriously. `jekyll serve --drafts` reminds of first time I typed `npm run watch` and blew my mind.  

I'll probably end up revisiting and improving the site over time,  
something I never really would have been able to do with SquareSpace.  
*It feels like my actual site now.*  

#### Shutting Down Twitter ####

Twitter is pretty amazing.  
It's like the perfect slot machine.  
"*What little 140 character piece of snark or news or snarky news will I refresh into this time?*"  

It's funny how much "down time" I magically had when I was addicted to something I told myself was only for down time.

I can't even imagine how often I would have checked twitter had I actually been interacting with people.  
In the yearish that I had a twitter I had maybe a handful "meaningful" interactions.  
It's not for lack of planning.  

I just felt awkward interrupting people's lives as a "rando".  
Maybe some would have welcomed it?  

I talked with my therapist about this regularly.  
I felt like everyone in Queer/Trans twitter was cooler than me and already friends IRL.  
Non Queer/Trans twitter terrified me a little.  
I think I should have shut it down long ago.

Most importantly,  
Twitter filled some sort of "Public Platform/Voice" itch.  
It's no coincidence that my post rate dropped to near zero as soon as I had a twitter.  
Now the only alternative to a blog post when I have an thought is a Facebook post. (lol).

now for some light book-keeping...

##### What happened to Vim Adventures? #####

I originally "learned" vim using [Vim Adventures][4].  
I was a little dismayed at the lack of a walkthrough for a puzzle game and so I thought I'd write one.  
The difficulty in creating a clear, quality walkthrough quickly grew out of control...  

It was something I ever really acknowledged.  
The Walkthrough just kind of sat in the back of my brain for a year,  
making me feel wracked with guilt at random moments.

So fuck it?
It didn't export/import cleanly and I didn't want to take the time to fix up the little that I had done.  
Sorry if you really were looking forward to its continuation for a year...  

(as an aside...)  
I don't really think it helped me learn vim at all.  
The best way I found is to just use vim whenever you can and   
slowly add new commands as you find yourself doing repetivive things.   
I've been using VsVim and Vimium for the past 2 years,   
vim zsh bindings for the past year, and   
neovim for the past 3 months with pretty ok results.  

##### What happened to a certain post? It was my favorite! #####

I don't believe you.  

I did in fact delete and (lightly) edit some posts as I was doing the migration.  
There were two types of posts I removed.  
Ones where I  

- Sound like a teenage girl with a new LiveJournal
- Sound like I just woke to the idea of social justice and I'm naively virtue signaling 

Honestly, both of those are/were true.  
But that doesn't mean the posts are worth anything...
