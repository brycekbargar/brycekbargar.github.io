So I've had this site for little over a year.  
One year.  
No one starts a blog with the intention to write 4 posts, [all aplogizing for not blogging more][0].  
That's kind of what I ended up with.

So.  
Rather than just continue with what was obviously not working,  
I made a couple of changes to how I approach this site.

now for some light book-keeping...

#### What happened to Vim Adventures? ####

I originally "learned" vim using [Vim Adventures][3].  
I was a little dismayed at the lack of a walkthrough for a puzzle game and so I thought I'd write one.  
The difficulty in creating a clear, quality walkthrough quickly grew out of control...  

It was something I ever really acknowledged.  
The Walkthrough just kind of sat in the back of my brain for a year,  
making me feel wracked with guilt at random moments.

So fuck it?
It didn't export/import cleanly and I didn't want to take the time to fix up the little that I had done.  
Sorry if you really were looking forward to its continuation for a year...  

(as an aside...)  
I don't really think it helped me learn vim at all.  
The best way I found is to just use vim whenever you can and   
slowly add new commands as you find yourself doing repetivive things.   
I've been using VsVim and Vimium for the past 2 years,   
vim zsh bindings for the past year, and   
neovim for the past 3 months with pretty ok results.  

#### What happened to a certain post? It was my favorite! ####

I don't believe you.  

I did in fact delete and edit some posts as I was doing the migration.  
There were two types of posts I removed.  
Ones where I  

- Sound like a teenage girl with a new LiveJournal
- Sound like I just woke to the idea of social justice and I'm naively virtue signaling 

Honestly, both of those are/were true.  
But that doesn't mean the posts are worth anything...
