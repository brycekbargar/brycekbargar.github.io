For some reason I do everything in life except what I actually want.  
Since High School all I've wanted was learn how to work with signal processing and get a job at Adobe.  
Since High School I've done everything possible to avoid making progress towards that goal.  
Life is way easier when you only do things you're good at.  
Life is way easier when you only do what that little voice in the back of your head says "they" want.  
Don't do anything too crazy; you might fail, or worse; you might stand out.   

I've started a couple of different open source projects,  
most recently Nilgiri which was supposed to be a .NET port of ChaiJS.  
While it was fun learning the basics of DNX I quickly lost interest in the project.  
What started as me wanting Expect assertion syntax in .NET   
ballooned into something I neither wanted to write, use or maintain.  
All because "They would be impressed by it in my portfolio"   
or "I would become internet famous and be accepted by them".  
And so I started writing, in my precious free-time, an enterprise software library. 

I'm done.

I'm going to clean up Nilgiri to wrap xunit and call it complete.  
Then I'm going to start doing what I've always wanted.  
Learning DSP and make crazy sounds. Bring on the textbooks!
