yes.

Incredibly sterotypical. Incredibly nerdy. Whatever.

If I actually took the time to create the perfect first blog entry;  
the one that accurately described my whole life,  
the one that encompassed all my thoughts and emotions,  
the one the would make any reader instantly in love with me;  
it would take me like 25 years to get over myself and I'd end up writing a post where I rambled and didn't care to spell check or care to engage anyone.

oh wait.

So yeah. I'm going to write things.  
Things like "Today I sold everything I owned and moved to Chicago to live with people I met on Craigslist",  
things like "I'm gay! No wait, I'm a woman! No wait, I'm a gay woman?!",  
things like "How to implement a dynamic Web API model validator that is fully testable using reflection and dependency injection".

My grammar is awful.   
I had a teacher that told me, "You have to learn the rules before you can break them".  
I never actually learned them.  
And then I learned c++.   
And then I started starting sentences with "and".   
And then I decided to use sentence structure to make the content interesting.  
So you'll have to read my blog like a human/compiler cyborg built by a drunken Jack Kerouac...

I'm getting ready to move in with my urban homesteading fiance.  
I'm getting ready to go on a week long Texas road trip presenting as a genderqueer unicorn.  
I'm getting ready to learn how to write sexy code again.  
Lots of interesting future things peppered with reflections on my life through a not so common lense.  

It's taken 25 years of mercilessly refactoring life to get here.  
Somewhere interesting, unique, challenging, beautiful.  

I'm not stopping any time soon.
