[For the uninitiated.][0]

I'm of the unpopular opinion that paying down technical debt is a luxury.   
[Shipping is a feature.][1]

This is why it is so important to hire people who have made enough mistakes to know how to implement a feature and architect a product to minimize the amount of debt accrued.

As much as I hated doing CRUD app after CRUD app while consulting it was hugely formative.  
I got to build project after project, alone and from scratch,   
until I finally understood n-tier architecture, DI, testing, SOC and every other buzzword.  
It's now something instinctual, something more than just academic knowledge.

This is why it is silly thinking that code schools will give you anything other then someone who knows the latest HTML5/CSS/Ruby buzzwords.

The same applies to [personal technical debt][2].  
Things like tooling, keeping up with the industry, hacking on interesting things in your free time.  
Everything surrounding the process of software development that you know you should be doing.  

Just like when you feel slightly guilty checking in code without fully Unit/Integration testing it,  
you should feel slightly guilty for firing up Steam while you haven't touched one of your github repos in days.  

Except paying down personal technical debt is also a luxury.

If your project/product is constantly in panic mode, you're more likely to commit a bunch of hacks with things like  
`// TODO: I  know this is awful, but it works?`  
And that's actually fine as long as you know you know   
full well that you are borrowing time from future you to get it shipped.  

It is the same with your personal life.   
Finances, Family, Addiction, Friends, Health, Television, Excessive Gaming, Loneliness, Anxiety, Fear, Depression, Self-Sabotage.  
This is all real Maslow's emergency level shit and needs to be taken care of.  

For me it was crippling gender dysphoria.

Waking up refreshed in the morning; being willing and able to leave the house is shipping.  
It's a required feature of life.  
Getting to this point is way more important than learning grep/awk/zsh.  

But at some point in the future a stable and sane and happy you will have to pay it back.

Here's where you say, 

> "But Bryce, you spend 8-10 hours a day programming at work, surely you can learn some new things." 

This is the most insidious thing though,   
once you fall behind the tech curve it becomes harder and harder to jump back on.  
Go try and find an MVC 3 job that would be responsive to you attending a NodeJS conference.  
Go try and find a .NET consulting job that would give you a MBP to hack on.  

I was incredibly fortunate to figure my shit out and get a modern job based solely on my knowledge and capabilities in C# and .NET OOP.
But that gravy train is over and now I need to learn and improve on my tooling.

I'm starting to pay myself back and make lasting changes for yet another time and subject in my life.  
This is why I called the blog   
"**Mercilessly Refactored Life**" and not something like  
"*Changing small habits for a couple of weeks*" or  
"*Stagnation is fine in this day and age*".  

Unrelated, right now I'm working through [Vim Adventures][3].   
Over the next couple of weeks I'm going to be putting together a walkthrough for it   
since I was really surprised one didn't exist   
and sometimes it's frustrating that the game part gets in the way of actually learning vim...
