<p>(i'm having trouble putting my thoughts together on a couple of actual topics... so in the mean time I'm writing pretty awful "filler" because I promised myself I'd write 25 minutes every other day)</p>
<p>NYC is awful...</p>
<p>Maybe it's just my southern middle-class suburban upbringing, but I like having space. When I first moved to Chicago the hardest thing to adjust to was the cramped living situations I found myself in. Random Craigslist roommates, 300 sq. ft. studios, basements. ex-fiance as a roommate.&nbsp;All just a different flavor of claustrophobic. Which, for some people is alright. When finally found a space here that I can feel comfortable in, it really helped my mental state and allowed me to (sort of) flourish.</p>
<p>NYC takes claustrophobia to 11. Every street is packed with cars and multi-unit buildings in a way Chicago never approaches. Maybe it would be different if I lived there long term, but I see no way that I would ever be able to make noise and have privacy and breathe like I can here. Like, how does anyone own a drumset?&nbsp;It's not just Manhattan. I spent a night wandering through Brooklyn and the surrounding neighborhoods and it was more of the same. Just multi-unit building after multi-unit buiding.</p>
<p>Anyways. We need $1 pizza here, and I liked how New York wasn't super segregated like Chicago but I don't think I ever want to like somewhere that claustrophobic...</p>
