<p>I've previously written about <a href="http://brycekbargar.com/blog/pickle-nutella-quesadillas">eating Soylent as a transwoman</a>. Recently (ok maybe like a month ago...) someone reached out to me on Twitter asking if I had any follow up about that post. So I guess it's time for an 8ish month update on Soylent.</p>
<p>I've been lucky. I've always been reasonably able to control my body composition, though with one caveat... When I'm trying to radically change my body composition it basically consumes my entire life, making it hard to maintain long-term.</p>
<p>I've experimented with many different styles of eating, all forms of Vegetarian/Vegan/Paleo as well as some crazier experiments with eating on alternate days and drinking a gallon of milk a day. I've been all shapes and sizes, 155 pounds of vegan skin and bones to 240 pounds of powerlifting muscle and various versions of lean/chubby in the middle.<br />Soylent seemed like a natural fit for someone who has never cared to follow conventional eating. Especially for someone trying to adjust to post-transition nutrition, dropping muscle, gaining good fat, and dealing with a slowing metabolism.</p>
<p>Making the transition to Soylent hasn't been smooth sailing. Besides the sodium issue I touched on in my last post, the biggest issue I have is that Soylent takes 2 hours to mix.</p>
<p>On the surface this is an easy problem, just mix up a days calories in the morning and drink it over the course of the day. After drinking Soylent I feel full in the sense that I'm no longer hungry, but Soylent itself isn't very filling. At least for me, this means it's really easy to consume a days worth of Soylent in a few hours leading to me eating too many calories. It's hard to connect an amount of mixed Soylent with how hungry you are; it's hard to know how hungry you'll be first thing in morning. Mixing an exact number of calories every day and sticking with that would have been excellent for old me, but doesn't help me learn to loosen up and get in touch with my body and how I feel.</p>
<p>So here's what I do.</p>
<p>I "fast" in the morning, which really just means that I skip breakfast and wait until I'm hungry, usually around 11 or 12. I've started bulk cooking on weekends, so I usually have ~20 mason jars of 4-5 different dishes in my freezer at any given time. I grab one and heat it up, most of the time stretching it with rice (also liberal amounts of salt...). While it's heating up, I mix up enough Soylent for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Waiting to mix Soylent until I'm hungry means I can take an accurate gauge of how much I'll need. At first I was pretty terrible, either making way too much or way too little, but over time it's teaching me how to listen to my body and not live rigidly by numbers.</p>
