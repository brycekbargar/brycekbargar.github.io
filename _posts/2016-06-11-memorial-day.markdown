##### Memorial Day #####

I had a lovely morning.  

Slept in.  
Made a wonderful flat white.  
Cooked my usual weekend brunch of CongrÃ­ and Fried Bananas.  
Parked myself on the couch in my PJs and started programming with One Piece as background noise.  
I was working on a [small (still in progress) app][0] to help me figure out where to live next year.

It was a gorgeous day outside.  
The day before while running errands everyone seemed to be asking

> "It's such a nice day out! Have any plans to enjoy it?"

Small talk.  
This question comes up all the time, "Have any plans?"  
And for years, to me it's always come across as

> "Do you have plans? Do you have **friends**? Are you _pathetic_ and _lonely_?"

<!--more-->

In the past I would have lied and said something generic like, "Going to a BBQ with some friends".  
But now I just kind of shrug and say, "I have the windows open?"  

Because the truth of it is,   
_I'm fine by myself_.

Memorial Day, the neighbors I share an alley with decided to have a party.  
One of those Chicago summer parties that start at 3pm and involve 12 hours grilling and drinking.

As long as I was heads down and focused on what I was building I was fine,  
but as soon as I took a break I kept having this thought.

> "They must think I'm so _pathetic_, spending Memorial Day alone, inside, binge watching **anime** of all things!"

In the past, I would have let these words get to me.  
To eat me up inside.  
To send me into a depressive spiral where I end up becoming _actually_ pathetic.

Which is ridiculous.  
I'm completely over it.  
Now I'm just waiting for my self-talk to get the memo.

This mindset is a huge shift from even 3 months ago,   
basically since Junior High I've had this weird hangup about what it means to be alone.

For the longest time I thought I just need to fix this _one last thing_ about me,  
then I'd be able to go out and meet people and have a busy social calendar. 

I thought I'd finally stop being pathetic.

The latest "fix" has been transitioning.  
I thought HRT would make me more comfortable with my body,   
and allow me to interact with people and make friends.  

Turns out fixing shit about myself isn't nearly as important as fixing shit about my perspective.

HRT has done that.  
I find that it's basically impossible to describe the mental shifts that happen.  
I'm becoming more comfortable with my body every day,  
but that pales in comparison to _finally_ being able to think for **myself** about what **I** _actually_ want and what _actually_ makes **me** happy.

And what I want?   
Nothing makes me happier than pouring over technical documentation, alone, in front of an open window on a day off from Work.
