I've started working on the walkthrough for [Vim Adventures][0]. For me the tool is way easier to learn the keys and actions than editing live text. I always get super frustrated when working in vim because it is such a productivity hit while learning. This takes away any concept of productivity and really forces you to do learn the "Vim Way" to do things.

Anyways. [Here's the walkthrough.][1] It's also in the top navigation under \`vim foo.bar\`.
