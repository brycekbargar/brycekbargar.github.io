I was very excited when I was offered a 100% remote job.  

- no commute
- working in my underwear
- no bullshit guilt for leaving on time
- not having to think about which bathroom is the least awkward 
- cat 24/7

I had heard the negatives.  
Work and life blending together, distraction, fear of non-remote workers thinking you are slacking.  
But, as in most things I thought I was awesome enough to just handle it without a plan.  

Such naivety.

This post is about the tools I've stumbled upon to maintain my sanity, work-life balance and productivity.

### Bi-phasic sleep. ###

This very handily solves the work-life balance issue.  
Every day at 3:15 I take a 90 minute nap.  
Pretty simple, right?   
wake up at 4:45 and my work laptop will be asleep and chat will be quiet   
and I have a clear delineation of work and life.  
In order to facilitate this I have to start work at 6, which I actually prefer.  
Bi-phasic sleeping also allows me to be out at a show until 12am   
then still wake up at 5am fully refreshed and ready for work.  

### Time-boxing.

I work in four 25 minute intervals with three 5 minute breaks between them;  
after 115 minutes I take a 15 minute break.  
When I time-box my work it helps ease the anxiety that I'm not productive enough because I have something that says,  
"I worked sixteen 25 minute distraction-free intervals today".  
(give or take some internal meetings/discussions).  
One of the best things about working from home is the ability to take care of shit,  
with time-boxing I'm still able to take advantage of it without being distracted or unproductive.  
5 minute break? Feed cat.  
5 minute break? Fetch UPS package.  
5 minute break? Move laundry to dryer.  
15 minute break? Play through a new drum exercise.  
It also helps keep my out of my "clever, zone-induced rabbit holes" I've been prone to in the past.  
Just clean, maintainable, tested code.  

### Soylent.

All the positives of Soylent are amplified working from home.  
It's even easier to prepare/transport since it's my own kitchen.  
Every morning I mix 6 scoops in 6 mason jars and put them in the fridge.  
It's really easy to fall into the "I'm home, I might as well cook lunch too" trap which I did at first.  
While it was awesome to have a giant Bahn Mi burrito or a Egg Florentine Quesadilla;  
I spent all my recovered commute time on cooking in dishes.  
Soylent really drives home that I work remote so I can spend exactly 8 hours a day making money,  
then the rest of the day is completely free.
