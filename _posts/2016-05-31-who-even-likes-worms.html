<p>My whole life I've woken with an alarm.<br />From the soft rolling of my father's knuckles on my bedroom door in middle school<br />to my trusty Indiglo alarm that served me through high school and college<br />to my ultra-minimalist phone alarm clock post grad<br />finally culminating in carefully orchestrated and timed system of Sonos speakers.</p>
<p>It's something I never really questioned.<br />My father, my earliest role model, wakes every morning at 4:30.<br />To me, it's just something responsible adults do.<br />Early to bed and all that jazz...</p>
<p>Upon graduation I was big on work/life balance,<br />an idea I'm slowly trying to get back to after watching it slowly slip away.<br />Two weeks ago some things shifted around at work,<br />and despite being an hour behind the main business I was suddenly free to come and go as I please.<br />"Just get your work done and put in your time."</p>
<p>So I shut off all my alarms.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if it's 12 years of conditioning,<br />or the early summer sun,<br />or a hungry mewling of my 17lb Maine Coone<br />but I wake up at 7 every morning now.<br />Only 30 minutes later than what I had my alarm set to.</p>
<p>A digression.<br />In my last job I had a commute of ~15 minutes (South Chicago is wonderful).<br />Towards the end I started taking advantage of the short commute to make a slightly longer morning routine.<br />I'd take my coffee and sit down at my computer and code.<br />It was amazing!<br />I'm learning so much!<br />No interruptions or weariness in the early morning!<br />Taking a sip of cold, ignored coffee was a sip of triumph!</p>
<p>When I started working remote I reclaimed those 15 minutes<br />(and also the 30 or so I would spend preparing for a day away from home).<br />Instead of continuing to build on the freedoms morning afforded me I went in the opposite direction.<br />I fell into a careful routine. Latte, Webcomics/News, Shower?, Work.<br />All to be in by 8 and out by 4 so I could "get on with my day".</p>
<p>It's strange though; being slave to an alarm clock changes me.</p>
<p>I know I'm going to be jarred awake at at exactly 6:30.<br />Which means I need to be in bed by exactly 10:30.<br />Which means I need to start getting ready and settle in with a book around 10.</p>
<p>I'm terrible with schedules.<br />Not like many people who can't keep them.<br />Not like many people who just seem to be 15 minutes early magically.<br />Schedules and times give me a terrible form of anxiety.<br />Going on a date at 8pm? Better start obsessing about being ready at 5:30.<br />Therapy at noon? 10:30 seems about right to start continually checking the clock.<br />In bed by 10pm? I don't really want get involved in this project at 6pm in case I lose track of time.<br />Going to bed on a fixed schedule is no different, though it always subconscious.<br />8 hours of sleep is important you know!</p>
<p>About 5 weeks ago I kind of said "Fuck It",<br />I'm tired of this purgatory and I'm just going to work.<br />Maybe it's the lingering Summer sun,<br />or the fear of falling behind in tech,<br />or the renewed interest in life as my body is finally taking a shape I can live with<br />but I just fell into the zone and worked until midnight for multiple weeks.</p>
<p>Being tired is nothing new to me.<br />I was constantly falling asleep in class.<br />I would drink pots of coffee to stay awake my summers as a counselor.<br />Naps and nicotine fueled my early post-grad life.</p>
<p>But this time it's different.<br />I've been through this cycle of<br /><code>Exhaustion -&gt; Lethargy -&gt; Overflowing Energy -&gt; Hyperproductivity -&gt; Exhaustion</code><br />enough times to see it coming again.</p>
<p>So I shut off all my alarms.</p>
<p>It's strange how instantly the previously unknown stress of a scheduled wake/sleep was immediately lifted.<br />My mornings are now slow and meandering.<br />I read.<br />I actually enjoy my morning latte.<br />I do more self-care in getting ready.<br />I code and write and <em>just think</em>.<br />I, most importantly, feel well-rested and well-adjusted and well-paced.</p>
<p>Though there are still some kinks.</p>
<p>Working 10ish to 6ish is uncomfortable<br />It almost feels like the day has passed before I've even started.<br />I guess I can't reasonably expect to comfortably end 6 years of being the early bird.<br />When I get off at 6 my first thought is still always,<br />"It's way too late to start anything now..."<br />I constantly have to remind myself to<br />"Just start. You can finish and go to bed when you want, it's not like you have to wake up a given hour."</p>
<p>Drums are loud...<br />Getting off work at 4 meant I had some wiggle room to practice before I felt like I would be disrupting the evening quiet.<br />Getting off work at 6 means I have to start immediately and can't make a 3 hour exploration into something that catches my attention.<br />Though I'm sure I'll adjust. Maybe a long lunch?</p>
<p>Winter<br />Winters here are brutal because the sun pulls a disappearing act.<br />I'll have to watch carefully as the days shorten to see what happens.<br />A SAD lamp purchase is definitely going to happen by November.</p>
