In June of 2014 I got my ears pierced. I was something I'd wanted for as long as I can remember, but avoided even it even after I considered myself an independent adult. Now I see it one of the first steps I took in loosening my hyper-masculine identity which eventually helped me come out as trans.

The piercer was super nice and I had no trouble trusting him to shove a 3mm needle and 4mm taper into my ears. The next six months were relearning how to put on a shirt, how to use a towel, how to sleep on my back, how to wear a winter hat, how to...

Finally after months of irrational paranoia that my ears would rot and fall off I was ready for my first stretch. 4g was easy. So was 2g, 1g, 0g, 00g-, 00g+, 7/16", 12mm and now 1/2". I have 1 more stretch until I'm at my goal, but I'm not in a huge hurry.

Over the past year and a half my as the pieces of glass in my ears have grown so has my relation with them. What I originally started because I thought "they looked cool" have taken on a life of their own. (they still look cool...)

Mornings where getting out of bed seems difficult and any form of self-care seems impossible my ears are there, demanding jojoba massages. My eyebrow is there, demanding cleaning. My nose screw is probably on my pillow somewhere demanding to be reinserted.

When there isn't much I like about my face my piercings are there, reminding me that I am beautiful. When I get misgendered in public, misgendered at work, misgendered in my own fucking house my piercings are there reminding me that I control my body. They give my hands something to play with when I'm anxious in social situations. They give my mind something constant to focus on when the rest of my life feels so in flux.

One of my biggest fears and sources of anxiety is that I'll lose my job tomorrow and be unemployable. It was what caused me to fall so deep into minimalism and early retirement after graduation.

At least for me, that path is untenable and the the self-righteousness/guilt/self-hate it caused masked my gender dysphoria for way too many years. This fear is mostly unfounded. With my skills and experience and finely honed ability to be exactly what is expected I could cut my hair, throw on a couple sports bras, take out my piercings, discard my new name and online presence, buy some business casual, and have a job offer safely slaving away in a cubicle by next week. I've done it before.

While knowing I can easily enter that world relieves some anxiety, It's no coincidence that I lasted a combined eight months at the two jobs where "appearance" and "professionalism" mattered (also where I had to wear shoes...). My piercings have become an outward reminder that I have to be better than the average cubicle-bound wage-slave. I have to keep pushing and getting better so I can make employment decisions on my own terms. I can only accept employers, relationships, landlords and cities where I am fully accepted as myself. As Bryce.
