I was born white, in the suburbs of Houston. I was raised as firmly middle class; slightly outcast but surrounded by people sharing my background. I studied Electrical/Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University, where I was surrounded by people sharing my background. I moved to the Lakeview neighborhood of Chicago shortly after graduation and worked as a Software Developer; yet again surrounded by people sharing my background.

Communication was never hard for me.

Then I found the real world.

I've recently moved into a house with my partner in North Lawndale. On any given morning I will be the only white person boarding the Pink Line. 4 blocks south is 26th street where you are more likely to find stores and people that speak no English than ones that speak any English.

But this train of thought didn't start here.

It really started when I found myself consistently being unable to speak about LGBT issues. I just had no language to describe what I was feeling besides "gay" or "bi, but in denial about being gay". The only reason I had even these labels is because I was called them. Repeatedly. And so going though every day unable to describe myself and my feelings during my internal monologue, much less to co-workers or "friends" or roommates was crippling. It was the first inkling I had at living in a world I was unable to interact with in anything more than a superficial level.

So in June of 2014 I culminated months of laying on my floor in a blanket taco with calling in sick on a Monday. And coming unknowingly close to calling in sick for the rest of life.

During all of this I still appeared sane and normal and healthy to those that knew me. Why? Because they all shared my white suburban upbringing and I was able to communicate and affect this small sphere of my life.

So I started going to therapy. I found a nice LGBT therapist and spent an hour every week exploring vocabulary and concepts. Slowly my world turned from black and white; gay and straight; alcoholic and boring; male and female; rich and poor; workaholic and deadbeat; cheap and bullshit consumerist; intelligent and unworthy into a million shades of grey. (We made a lot of EL James jokes during this time...)

But the biggest take away from therapy was that being in control of your language allows you to affect your inner dialog and your surroundings in new and exciting ways.

I'm practicing Spanish every day. 30-75 minutes a day on my commute, 5 days a week for 6 months. I can can read it proficiently. Write it passingly. Hear it poorly. Speak it? lol. I feel anxious and embarrassed and a million other emotions in the checkout line while trying to decide if i'm buying a bottle of wine in english or Spanish.

But until now I had never correlated my anxiety about speaking Spanish with my anxiety about my gender identity. I'm learning Colemak. Somehow I made it this far by typing with 4 fingers and having to stare at the keyboard. Sure it's ~70 wpm, but it's pretty embarrassing... The cracks really started to show when I wanted to learn vim, and had to lift my hands off the keyboard to find the d key. [It was time to pay down some technical debt][0] and learn to touch type.

Except habits are really hard to break. I couldn't force myself to not look at the keys, so I decided to make the keys useless and switched to Colemak. It was painful. It still is painful. The first time I tried to message someone at 10 wpm and realized I could only send one 10 word message every minute I almost gave up.

But it made me notice something. That same anxiety was present; just because I couldn't type 3 words in a row without mixing up r and s and e. The same anxiety I felt trying to communicate that I wanted 2 scoops of mint on a waffle cone. The same anxiety I felt trying to communicate that I was born differently and that was ok.

I finally understand how important it is for people to have a voice, and how devastating "being silenced" can be. Or at least some parts of it. Call it growing up a little.
