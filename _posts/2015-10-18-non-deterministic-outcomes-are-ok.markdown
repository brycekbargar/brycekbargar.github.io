I'm pretty good at realizing when I'm not happy, making a plan to change my life drastically, then mostly sticking to that plan. There was the cage-fighting period, the boy racer years, the hyper-masculine Texas A&M cult membership, the early time in Chicago as a gay-minimalist-brogrammer, and finally my current genderfucked "software dev + musician" state.  When I was younger I didn't really understand what I was doing, but over time and self-examination I started viewing this more a "life refactoring" and being intentional about it. Most importantly they've become less and less about adopting social scripts to conform and more about moving through life as a confident autonomous human being.

What has tied these all together has been seething negative self-image and self-talk. "You have to do exactly these things and if you don't you're a failure and they won't like you" (it's always some nondescript they). Each "revelation" and movement between identities has quieted the inner voice for a time, until I start going off-plan. Once the negative self-talk starts creeping in it becomes the worst kind of positive feedback loop until I'm curled up on the floor eating 2lbs of Twizzlers so I don't have to feel anymore. (I wish this wasn't something that has happened at multiple points in my life...)

So when I embarked on my current plan it involved certain promises. Write every other day, eat more Soylent, practice music 2 hours a day, write software for an hour a day, etc... And for awhile it worked, though I hadn't defined what "worked" meant. In the past "worked" was always to be accepted by them. To be cool. To be popular. To fit in. Which is a pretty fucked set of goals for someone who hates groups as much as I do. So when I got over my shit and embarked on my current journey for myself without and end goal the goal became the plan and process and commitment itself. 

I've been busy lately. OkCupid has provided my with an awesome stream of interesting queer people to meet. I've been slowly digging up past friendships. Writing silly throw away code not hosted on github makes programming fun again. Most importantly I've been having fun just hitting drums and keys in a totally unstructured yet incredibly therapeutic way. Life is good. 

Life is really fucking good.

But that doesn't stop the negative self-talk. "Bryce! You aren't sticking to the practice schedule you made. They are never going to be impressed by your awful racket until you become more technical." "Bryce! You haven't written a blog in a week. They are going to think you're a dirty, lazy liar." "Bryce! You're eating out with people too much. They'll never find you attractive unless you careful follow the eating plan." "Bryce! You haven't finished yet another project on github. They're going to think you are too non-committal and no one will take you seriously as a dev"

Fuck. That. Noise.

Not quite sure where this is going besides something super preachy like, "You shouldn't have to earn your own approval by sticking to an arbitrary set of rules you created in an attempt to reach an undefined state of 'happy'"...

More ellipseses never hurt anyone.....
