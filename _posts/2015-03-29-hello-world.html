<p>yes.</p>
<p>Incredibly sterotypical. Incredibly nerdy. Whatever.</p>
<p>If I actually took the time to create the perfect first blog entry; the one that accurately described my whole life, the one that encompassed all my thoughts and emotions, the one the would make any reader instantly in love with me; it would take me like 25 years to get over myself and I'd end up writing a post where I rambled and didn't care to spell check or care to engage anyone.</p>
<p>oh wait.</p>
<p>So yeah. I'm going to write things. Things like "Today I sold everything I owned and moved to Chicago to live with people I met on Craigslist", things like "I'm gay! No wait, I'm a woman! No wait, I'm a gay woman?!", things like "How to implement a dynamic Web API model validator that is fully testable using reflection and dependency injection".</p>
<p>My grammar is awful. I had a teacher that told me, "You have to learn the rules before you can break them". I never actually learned them. And then I learned c++. And then I started starting sentences with "and". And then I decided to use sentence structure to make the content interesting. So you'll have to read my blog like a human/compiler cyborg built by a drunken Jack Kerouac...</p>
<p>I'm getting ready to move in with my urban homesteading fiance. I'm getting ready to go on a week long Texas road trip presenting as a genderqueer unicorn. I'm getting ready to learn how to write sexy code again. Lots of interesting future things peppered with reflections on my life through a not so common lense.</p>
<p>It's taken 25 years of mercilessly refactoring life to get here. Somewhere interesting, unique, challenging, beautiful. </p>
<p>I'm not stopping any time soon.</p>
