<p>For a long time coffee was an integral part of my "strong masculine identity". I only drank the darkest, sludgiest drip with no cream or sugar or milk. Like a real man. I had never had expresso or a latte until this past March, and only after a long unpacking of feelings.&nbsp;Which is about as ridiculous as it sounds...&nbsp;</p>
<p>After falling in love with Soy Lattes and then realizing how expensive said Lattes were I started looking at making them at home. There were various methods and tools, from full blown Expresso Machines to Aeropresses and pan-heated milk. I did my research and this is V1 of "Bryce's Adventures in Soy Lattes at Home".</p>
<h2>Beans</h2>
<p dir="ltr">I started with Metropolis Redline. It seemed to get good reviews,&nbsp;was roasted in Chicago, and (for better or worse) was available at Mariano's.&nbsp;I could say something about chocolate and wine and vanilla and other pretentious shit but I'm just going to say that I really like it. I'm definitely going to change beans often though, there are just too many good roasters in Chicago.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Grinding</h2>
<p dir="ltr">I bought a Hario Skerton awhile ago when I was trying to up my drip coffee game (lol)... It supposedly produces the same quality grounds as electric grinders ~4 times the price.&nbsp;I'm happy to report that it produces uniform grinds slightly courser than expresso, perfect for the Moka Pot. It only takes about 3 minutes to grind enough for a cup and is somewhat ok as morning exercise. I would like to compare it to other grinders, but I haven't used any others.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">"Expresso"</h2>
<p dir="ltr">I purchased a 4 cup Bialetti Brikka. While it doesn't make "true expresso" it makes really concentrated coffee and really pulls out flavors. There are even videos of it producing "crema", though I have not gotten mine to do it yet. The 4 cup size is about 4 expresso cups of volume and 2-3 expresso cups of caffeine. It's perfect for my "american" sized coffee mug because it leaves enough room for milk or foam or water. I may need to get a smaller cup if I want to drink it like expresso. For the time being I'm going to keep using this pot, home expresso machines just seem unjustifiable to me right now. (I'm also terrified of them...)</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Milk Frothing/Steaming</h2>
<p dir="ltr">I purchased a Bellman Stovetop Steamer. There were plenty of other simpler/cheaper methods but none of them seemed to be able to produce the same kind of milk as commercial machines. This one is pretty simple, put it on the stovetop with water and then steam comes out of the wand just like a real expresso machine!&nbsp;Learning how to actually use it is a completely different story... I don't think I steamed milk once with it overflowing the pitcher and getting everywhere or becoming way to bubbly and dry. Baby steps...</p>

<p dir="ltr">On a side note, writing a blog post + proofreading + adding links + adding pictures all in 25 minutes is very hard... Hopefully I will improve or become less ambitious over time.</p>
