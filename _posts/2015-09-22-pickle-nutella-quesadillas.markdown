I've started eating Soylent for ~90% of my meals during the week.  
There are many benefits,  
but their marketing department does a much better job than I ever could at enumerating them.  
I want to talk about my original experience with Soylent and what took me by surprise about it's nutrition.   

### One serving of Soylent only contains **16%** of the RDV of Sodium! ###

This very much surprised me.  
If someone were to subsist entirely on Soylent,  
they would only be getting **64%** of the recommended daily value of much maligned but still vital nutrient.  

wtf.

Sodium is more important for Transwomen than the larger community.  
Spironolactone, an off-label testosterone blocker, is also a potassium sparing diuretic.  
When I first started taking it without adjusting my diet   
I suffered from terrible cramping/spasming in my limbs and massive headaches.  
I adjusted my diet and was more conscious about my sodium levels,  
and eventually my body was able to regulate sodium and potassium as it did pre-HRT.   

So I was very surprised when I started eating Soylent and I had constant headaches and muscle cramps/spasms.  
The worst part though was the cravings.  
I craved McDonald's for the first time in years, and made many late night bicycle expeditions for them.  
I would make Guacamole with nearly impalpable levels of salt.  
Shitty frozen pizza was a super-guilty dietary staple.  
I felt awful, I like I was a failure that couldn't control her diet.

This went on for awhile until I started noticing the patterns of the food I was impulsively devouring.  
This caused me to look into the actual Nutrition Facts.  
And it really shocked me.  
I had expected Soylent to be the completely neutral default.  
~25% of everything per serving.  
Let the other DIY variations modify the levels of things.

So I started adding table salt to my Soylent.
Gross but effective...
