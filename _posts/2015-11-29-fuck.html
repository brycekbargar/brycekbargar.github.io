<p>I just bought "guy" shoes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought them because fuck you.</p>
<p>I will wear them with girl socks, guy jeans, a girl top, a guy jacket.</p>
<p>I will wear all those things because fuck you.</p>
<p>I am my own person.</p>
<p>Who are you to tell me only guys wear warm, minimalist size 11 shoes?&nbsp;Who are you to tell me that I have to like dresses now? I didn't transition just to have to check another set of boxes and follow another script. To listen to society or marketers or </p>
<p>I'm not even following the script of a cis-woman. I'm following the script of a trans-woman. Be offended and feel bad when you're misgendered. Like girly things. Be offended and feel bad when someone asks about "the surgery". Avoid manly things.&nbsp;Be offended and feel bad when you have to choose a bathroom. when you try dating, when you go to buy clothes, when you interact with anyone or do anything ever. Be normal. Don't stand out. Conform. Conform</p>
<p>That isn't my style. Not in the slightest.</p>
<p>So I'm just going to wear whatever. I'm just going to act however. I'm just going to do me.</p>
<p>(part of me hates that I am still having these sorts of revelations. or even calling them revelations. or really even spending anymore time thinking about gender when there are actual important things in life.)</p>
