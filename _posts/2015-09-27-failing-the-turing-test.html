<p>Awhile ago I bought tickets for the Lesbians Who Tech summit in New York. While I was looking at flights I realized it was silly to pay so much money for 2-3 rushed days, especially in a city like New York. Since I work remotely it's not like I'm especially attached to any physical location and I found a cheapish AirBnB with a quiet workspace. I'll be there for a week seeing live music, biking around Manhattan, drinking too much beer and coffee, and eating all the pizza.</p>
<p>I've been to New York before. My high school band played in Carnegie Hall, and I had a woodblock solo. Fuck Yeah Woodblocks... The trip itself was pretty awful. I was still trying to piece together a masculine identity, I didn't really have many friends due to a horrific breakup. (i was such an asshole...), but most of all New York was so different than what I was used to.</p>
<p>It's very hard to explain growing up as trans. Sure there is the standard "I always knew" narrative, but I didn't always know. I could talk about trying to fit into a #MasculinitySoFragile view of men, but that is something everyone growing up as male has to deal with. It's more like, I was really good at finding patterns of behavior and copying them. In a way beyond what most people even realize. Every day, every hour, every minute is dictated by a social script. Every social script is tweaked until it receives the maximum positive feedback. And there is no deviation. Ever.</p>
<p>When I was in New York in 2008, that was the first time I had been in a city. Something about the constantly buzzing energy of the city drew me in. It was so different. It felt cold and vast and... anonymous. I still don't know if I can put these feelings into words and I could just be remembering the past reimagined through a new lens, but that was the first time in my life where I felt I could just be. No scripts, no churning identity, no judgement. Just anonymity. I loved it, but I also hated that I couldn't fall into the city's steely embrace. I had to stick with the group and be chaperoned everywhere knowing I would eventually return to the stillborn suburb I came from.</p>
<p>When I had the chance to move to Chicago in 2012 after college I jumped on it. Unfortunately by that point I had accumulated 4 more years of emotional damage from Texas A&amp;M and floundered. The anonymousness no longer was enticing or comforting. It was soul-crushing. No one respected me as a "True Texas Gentleman" or any other bullshit scripts I was a slave to. But after some soul-searching and lots of therapy I'm back to loving the vastness that is the big city.</p>
