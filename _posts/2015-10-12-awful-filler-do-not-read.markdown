(i'm having trouble putting my thoughts together on a couple of actual topics...   
so in the mean time I'm writing pretty awful "filler" because I promised myself I'd write 25 minutes every other day)

NYC is awful...

<!--more-->

Maybe it's just my southern middle-class suburban upbringing, but I like having space.  
When I first moved to Chicago the hardest thing to adjust to was the cramped living situations I found myself in.

- random Craigslist roommates
- 300 sq. ft. studio
- basement
- ex-fiance as a roommate

All just a different flavor of claustrophobic.  
Which, for some people is alright.  
When finally found a space here that I can feel comfortable in,  
it really helped my mental state and allowed me to (sort of) flourish.  

NYC takes claustrophobia to 11.  
Every street is packed with cars and multi-unit buildings in a way Chicago never approaches.  
Maybe it would be different if I lived there long term,   
but I see no way that I would ever be able to make noise and have privacy and breathe like I can here.  
Like, how does anyone own a drumset?   
It's not just Manhattan.   
I spent a night wandering through Brooklyn and the surrounding neighborhoods and it was more of the same.  
Just multi-unit building after multi-unit buiding...   

Anyways.  
We need $1 pizza here.  
I liked how New York wasn't super segregated like Chicago but   
I don't think I ever want to like somewhere that claustrophobic...
