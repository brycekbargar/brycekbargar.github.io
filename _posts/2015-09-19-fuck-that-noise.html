<p><a target="_blank" href="http://brycekbargar.com/blog/happy-cat">In my last post</a>&nbsp;I talked about how I started using time-boxing at work to manage distractions and to help with my work/life balance. I loved the technique so much that I decided to partially apply it to my personal life.</p>
<p>My head is full of things I "should" be doing at all times in order to be a happy and productive adult. Unfortunately these are usually forgotten the moment I have free time... So I have decided to be more explicit about them. I've begun doing a full round of four 25-minute time-boxes every day (or at least most, I'm learning not to beat myself up over silly things).</p>
<p>These consist of the things I always mean to do, and know will lead to a happier me.&nbsp;Right now they are &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Stretching</li>
<li>Cleaning the House</li>
<li>Practicing Spanish</li>
<li>Training my Voice/Blogging on alternating days</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to have, every other day, a short blog entry that I have written in 25 minutes. I've been finding that super long and semi-thought out posts are intimidating to start writing, especially comparing myself to all the bloggers I read that have been doing it for years. Hopefully this gets me into the habit of regularly writing and will lead to higher quality posts over time. In the short run it will probably sound like I'm copy and pasting excerpts from the Simple English Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I figure that over time I will be happier with many small blog posts about what I'm doing rather than monolithic preachy rants that no one actually cares about... Because really I'm writing this thing mostly for me, probably my mother and sometimes random people.</p>
<p>Just since February I've gotten engaged to and moved in with a partner. Gotten unengaged from and moved out from said parter. I've started 2 jobs. I've published my first NuGet package. I've radically changed my diet. I've starting being able to express myself musically. My whole worldview has slowly been in upheaval.</p>
<p>But I have no record of that. Just because of some fucked up sense fear for not being good or insightful or eloquent enough. Fuck that noise.</p>
