<p>I was very excited when I was offered a 100% remote job. No commute, working in my underwear, no bullshit guilt for leaving on time, not having to think about which bathroom is the least awkward, cat 24/7.</p>

<p>I had heard the negatives. Work and life blending together, distraction, fear of non-remote workers thinking you are slacking. But, as in most things I thought I was awesome enough to just handle it without a plan.</p>
<p>Such naivety.</p>
<p>This post is about the tools I've stumbled upon to maintain my sanity, work-life balance and productivity.</p>
<h3>Bi-phasic sleep.</h3>
<p>This very handily solves the work-life balance issue. Every day at 3:15 I take a 90 minute nap. Pretty simple, right? I can wake up at 4:45 and my work laptop will be asleep and chat will be quiet and I have a clear delineation of work and life. In order to facilitate this I have to start work at 6, which I actually prefer. Bi-phasic sleeping has the added benefit of allowing me to be out at a show until 12am and still wake up at 5am fully refreshed and ready for work.</p>
<h3>Time-boxing.</h3>
<p>I work in four 25 minute intervals with three 5 minute breaks between them; after 115 minutes I take a 15 minute break.&nbsp;When I time-box my work it helps ease the anxiety that I'm distracted or not being productive enough because I literally have something to fall back on that says, "I worked sixteen 25 minute distraction-free intervals today". (give or take some internal meetings/discussions). One of the best things about working from home is the ability to take care of shit, with time-boxing I'm still able to take advantage of it without being distracted or unproductive. 5 minute break? Feed cat. 5 minute break? Fetch UPS package. 5 minute break? Move laundry to dryer. 15 minute break? Play through a new drum exercise. It helps disrupt my focus as well so I don't go into the "clever,&nbsp;zone-induced rabbit holes" I've been prone to in the past. Just clean, maintainable, tested code.</p>
<h3>Soylent.</h3>
<p>All the positives of Soylent are amplified working from home. It's even easier to prepare/transport since it's my own kitchen. Every morning I mix 6 scoops in 6 mason jars and put them in the fridge.&nbsp;It's really easy to fall into the "I'm home, I might as well cook lunch too" trap which I did at first. While it was awesome to have a giant Bahn Mi burrito or a Egg Florentine Quesadilla I spent all my recovered commute time on cooking in dishes. Eating Soylent really drives home the point that I work remote so I can spend exactly 8 hours a day making money,&nbsp;then the rest of the day is completely free.</p>
