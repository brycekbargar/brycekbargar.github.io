<p>Full Disclosure: I used to be a mediocre white dude and am still pretty much a mediocre white woman...</p>
<p>My Sophomore year of College I was like, "I should probably get an internship! That seems like something that people do!"<br />Well... I interviewed for a couple, but one really stood out.<br />I interviewed with Amazon. It went worse than poorly.</p>
<p>I was tasked with solving a trivial problem, which I misunderstood and over-complicated.<br />I also was asked (what I considered to be silly trivia at the time) a bunch of basic Unix questions.</p>
<pre><code>Write a program to count the occurrences of "cat" in a list given to you in the format
"cat, dog, cat, rabbit, lion, cat, lizard, ..."</code></pre>
<p>I went on a 20 minute heads down session of c++ multimaps and knew I was doing something wrong after having to fend off multiple questions of "Have you solved it yet?" and "This isn't difficult, perhaps you could just show me what you have to far."</p>
<p>This isn't even getting into how little I knew about <code>grep</code> and <code>sed</code>...</p>
<p>Even though at the time I wrote it off as being "Amazon Hard" and went back to working at a Boy Scout summer camp (yuck...), the interview stuck with me.<br />Luckily (and nepotistically...) I got an internship the next year at my Father's company doing SAP Business Object reporting.</p>
<p>This wasn't good enough though. I was just beginning to come to terms with my sexuality (totally into dudes) and knew I had to get to a big city to figure shit out.<br />So my senior year I devoured the shit out of any tech interview reading I could. Joel On Software <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html">(especially his Guerilla Guide)</a> shaped a lot of what I started reading to get hired.<br />I bought and read books on JQuery, C#, Enterprise Architecture, and Project Management and retooled my resume to make it seem like I knew what I was doing.<br />Make it seem like I was an extraordinary white dude and not just a mediocre one.</p>
<p>And it worked...</p>
<p>I got two job offers out of College (and ended up taking both, long story lol...). The technical interview process for them was mainly "C# is awesome, right?!" "Right!"<br />There is no way I could have pulled that shit off if I didn't somehow luck into being white, male, having a patriarchal connections, and miraculously going to a great engineering school for free.<br />That said. I put in a shit-ton of time and effort learning best-practices and becoming competent in IRL programming, estimation and architecture once I was hired.<br />Besides my bombed Amazon interview, technical interviews have just kind of been easy. </p>
<p>Which is where I now have a disconnect...</p>
<p>I'm a .NET witch. I know the stack and the paradigms inside out. I've done Web and Desktop and used MVC, MVVM, MVP along with Reflection, ORMs, CQRS, and hyper-templated OO.</p>
<p>When I hear <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/technical-interviews-are-bullshit">people talk about</a> how <a href="http://firstround.com/review/How-Etsy-Grew-their-Number-of-Female-Engineers-by-500-in-One-Year/">technical interviews</a> are <a href="https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/if-you-think-women-in-tech-is-just-a-pipeline-problem-you-haven-t-been-paying-attention-cb7a2073b996#.umfkbnbha">problematic</a> I really just don't understand...<br />I can read these sorts of articles all day, but will never really understand the problem. <strong>You either know tech or you don't.</strong></p>
<p>One of the crazier side effects of HRT is gaining the ability to empathize with people.<br />At first, it was overwhelming.<br />Empathy is weird, especially having it turned on from being in such a position of privilege.<br />It's like "I objectively know how things are, but still don't understand." Which is totally different than the pre-HRT "I know some people feel like this but they are probably wrong."</p>
<p>Imagine being a Geocentrist your whole life. Then one day you wake up and totally objectively understand Heliocentrism to be "The one true way" without having any of the scientific background to support the sudden switch.<br />Like, objectively I know that technical interviews bias towards people who are like the interviewer (i.e. cishet white males).<br />I could empathize. But I still couldn't understand.</p>
<p>Well... That was until I started drum lessons.</p>
<p>My lesson teacher, (who I may or may not have an unreasonable crush on...), will give me something to learn.<br />I will spend 6-7 hours the next week working towards that goal only to, most of the time, be unable to reproduce my efforts during lessons.</p>
<p>The drum kit is setup a little differently, the exercise isn't exactly what I've practiced, I'm girling harder than normal, there's the perception that he's way above me and I'm <em>just an imposter</em>.</p>
<p>This is all analogous to how tech interviews happen. You're using a strange setup, the problem is slightly different than what you're used to, you're wearing strange interview clothes and feel judged based on your appearance, the interviewer has already <em>made it</em> and your just an imposter.</p>
<p>But like, none of this is applicable to the actual job.</p></p>

<p>With lessons, I just put on a strong face and pretend things are going ok.</p>
<p>With a job interview, it is literally gatekeeping for an upper-middle class life.</p>
<p>Sure, I feel awkward saying that I can play the drums when I have nothing to show for it.<br />But that's night and day different than feeling awkward saying I can program when I can't pay the bills because no one will hire me.</p>
<p>A lot of <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Trans-exclusionary_radical_feminism">TERFS</a> talk about Transwomen being "socialized as male".<br />Which is actually kind of true... Like, looking back, the only way I made it through tech interviews is to have to silly over-confidence of a white-dude and having interviewers think "I'm like them."<br />Now that I've been "admitted to the club" I can bounce between jobs as needed.</p>
<p>So... I'm not really sure how to fix this or what to make of it. I've been hesitant to write this post since it really just seems to amount to "Look how woke I am! I'm so cool and progressive!"</p>
<p>I just kind of needed to get this out there and hope someone can make something of it.</p>
