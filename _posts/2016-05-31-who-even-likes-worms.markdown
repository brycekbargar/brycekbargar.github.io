My whole life I've woken with an alarm.  
From the soft rolling of my father's knuckles on my bedroom door in middle school  
to my trusty Indiglo alarm that served me through high school and college  
to my ultra-minimalist phone alarm clock post grad  
finally culminating in carefully orchestrated and timed system of Sonos speakers.

It's something I never really questioned.  
My father, my earliest role model, wakes every morning at 4:30\.  
To me, it's just something responsible adults do.  
Early to bed and all that jazz...

Upon graduation I was big on work/life balance,  
an idea I'm slowly trying to get back to after watching it slowly slip away.  
Two weeks ago some things shifted around at work,  
and despite being an hour behind the main business I was suddenly free to come and go as I please.  
"Just get your work done and put in your time."

So I shut off all my alarms.

I'm not sure if it's 12 years of conditioning,  
or the early summer sun,  
or a hungry mewling of my 17lb Maine Coone  
but I wake up at 7 every morning now.  
Only 30 minutes later than what I had my alarm set to.

A digression.  
In my last job I had a commute of ~15 minutes (South Chicago is wonderful).  
Towards the end I started taking advantage of the short commute to make a slightly longer morning routine.  
I'd take my coffee and sit down at my computer and code.  
It was amazing!  
I'm learning so much!  
No interruptions or weariness in the early morning!  
Taking a sip of cold, ignored coffee was a sip of triumph!

When I started working remote I reclaimed those 15 minutes  
(and also the 30 or so I would spend preparing for a day away from home).  
Instead of continuing to build on the freedoms morning afforded me I went in the opposite direction.  
I fell into a careful routine. Latte, Webcomics/News, Shower?, Work.  
All to be in by 8 and out by 4 so I could "get on with my day".

It's strange though; being slave to an alarm clock changes me.

I know I'm going to be jarred awake at at exactly 6:30\.  
Which means I need to be in bed by exactly 10:30\.  
Which means I need to start getting ready and settle in with a book around 10\.

I'm terrible with schedules.  
Not like many people who can't keep them.  
Not like many people who just seem to be 15 minutes early magically.  
Schedules and times give me a terrible form of anxiety.  
Going on a date at 8pm? Better start obsessing about being ready at 5:30\.  
Therapy at noon? 10:30 seems about right to start continually checking the clock.  
In bed by 10pm? I don't really want get involved in this project at 6pm in case I lose track of time.  
Going to bed on a fixed schedule is no different, though it always subconscious.  
8 hours of sleep is important you know!

About 5 weeks ago I kind of said "Fuck It",  
I'm tired of this purgatory and I'm just going to work.  
Maybe it's the lingering Summer sun,  
or the fear of falling behind in tech,  
or the renewed interest in life as my body is finally taking a shape I can live with  
but I just fell into the zone and worked until midnight for multiple weeks.

Being tired is nothing new to me.  
I was constantly falling asleep in class.  
I would drink pots of coffee to stay awake my summers as a counselor.  
Naps and nicotine fueled my early post-grad life.

But this time it's different.  
I've been through this cycle of  
`Exhaustion -> Lethargy -> Overflowing Energy -> Hyperproductivity -> Exhaustion`  
enough times to see it coming again.

So I shut off all my alarms.

It's strange how instantly the previously unknown stress of a scheduled wake/sleep was immediately lifted.  
My mornings are now slow and meandering.  
I read.  
I actually enjoy my morning latte.  
I do more self-care in getting ready.  
I code and write and _just think_.  
I, most importantly, feel well-rested and well-adjusted and well-paced.

Though there are still some kinks.

Working 10ish to 6ish is uncomfortable  
It almost feels like the day has passed before I've even started.  
I guess I can't reasonably expect to comfortably end 6 years of being the early bird.  
When I get off at 6 my first thought is still always,  
"It's way too late to start anything now..."  
I constantly have to remind myself to  
"Just start. You can finish and go to bed when you want, it's not like you have to wake up a given hour."

Drums are loud...  
Getting off work at 4 meant I could be more casual about when I start practicing.  
Getting off work at 6 means I can't begin 3 hour exploration into something that catches my attention.  
Though I'm sure I'll adjust. Maybe a long lunch?

Winter  
Winters here are brutal because the sun pulls a disappearing act.  
I'll have to watch carefully as the days shorten to see what happens.  
A SAD lamp purchase is definitely going to happen by November.
