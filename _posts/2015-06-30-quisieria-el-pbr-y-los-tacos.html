<p>I was born white, in the suburbs of Houston. I was raised as firmly&nbsp;middle class;&nbsp;slightly outcast but surrounded by people&nbsp;sharing my background. I studied Electrical/Computer Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University, where I was surrounded by&nbsp;people sharing my&nbsp;background. I moved to the Lakeview neighborhood of Chicago shortly after graduation and worked as a Software Developer; yet again surrounded by people sharing my background.</p>
<p>Communication was never hard for me.</p>
<p>Then I found the real world.</p>
<p>I've recently moved into a house with my partner in North Lawndale. On any given morning I will be the only white person boarding the Pink Line. 4 blocks south is 26th street where you are more likely to find stores and people that speak no English than ones that speak any English.</p>
<p>But this train of thought&nbsp;didn't start here.</p>
<p>It really started when I found myself consistently being unable to speak about LGBT issues. I just had no language to describe what I was feeling besides "gay" or "bi, but in denial about being gay". The only reason I had even these labels is because I was called them. Repeatedly. And so going though every day unable to describe myself and my feelings during&nbsp;my internal monologue, much less to co-workers or "friends" or roommates was crippling. It was the first inkling I had at living in a world&nbsp;I was unable to interact with in anything more than a superficial level.</p>
<p>So in June of 2014 I culminated months of laying on my floor in&nbsp;a blanket&nbsp;taco with calling in sick&nbsp;on a Monday. And coming unknowingly close to calling in sick for the rest of life.</p>
<p>During all of this I still appeared sane and normal and healthy to those that knew me. Why? Because they all shared my white suburban upbringing and I was able to communicate and affect this small sphere of my life.</p>
<p>So I started going to therapy. I found a nice LGBT therapist and spent an hour every week exploring vocabulary and concepts. Slowly my world turned from black and white; gay and straight; alcoholic and boring;&nbsp;male and female; rich and poor; workaholic and deadbeat;&nbsp;cheap and bullshit consumerist; intelligent and unworthy into a million shades of grey. (We made a lot of EL James jokes during this time...)</p>
<p>But the biggest take away from therapy was that being in control of your language allows you to affect your inner dialog and your surroundings in new and exciting ways.</p>
<p>I'm practicing Spanish every day. 30-75 minutes a day on my commute, 5 days a week for 6 months. I can can read it proficiently. Write it passingly. Hear it poorly. Speak it? lol. I feel anxious and embarrassed and a million other emotions in the checkout line while trying to decide if i'm buying a bottle of wine in english or Spanish.</p>
<p>But until now&nbsp;I had&nbsp;never correlated my anxiety about speaking Spanish with my anxiety about my gender identity.&nbsp;I'm learning Colemak. Somehow I made it this far by typing with 4 fingers and having to stare at the keyboard. Sure it's ~70 wpm, but&nbsp;it's pretty embarrassing... The cracks really started to show when I wanted to learn vim, and had to lift my hands off the keyboard to find the d key. <a target="_blank" href="http://brycekbargar.com/blog/vim-is-fucking-difficult">It was time to pay down some technical debt</a> and learn to touch type.</p>
<p>Except habits are really hard to break. I couldn't force myself to not look at the keys, so I decided to make the keys useless and switched to Colemak. It was painful. It still is painful. The first time I tried to message someone at 10&nbsp;wpm and realized I could only send one 10&nbsp;word message every&nbsp;minute I almost gave up.</p>
<p>But it made me notice something. That same anxiety was present;&nbsp;just because I couldn't type 3 words in a row without mixing up r and s and e.&nbsp;The same anxiety I felt trying to communicate that I wanted 2 scoops of mint on a waffle cone. The same anxiety I felt trying to communicate that I was born differently and that was ok.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I finally understand how important it is for people to have a voice, and how devastating&nbsp;"being silenced"&nbsp;can be. Or at least some parts of it. Call it growing up a little.</p>
<p> </p>
