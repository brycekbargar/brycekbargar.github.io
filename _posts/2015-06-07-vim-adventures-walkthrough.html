<p>I've started working on the walkthrough for <a href="http://vim-adventures.com/">Vim&nbsp;Adventures</a>. For me the tool is way easier to learn the keys and actions than editing live text. I always get super frustrated when working in vim because it is such a productivity hit while learning. This takes away any concept of productivity and really forces you to do learn the "Vim Way" to do things.</p>
<p>Anyways. <a href="http://brycekbargar.com/vim-adventures-walkthrough/">Here's the walkthrough.</a>&nbsp;It's also in the top navigation under `vim foo.bar`.</p>
