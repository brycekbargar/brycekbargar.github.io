### Finding a Place ###

When I moved to Chicago in 2012 I only had a single suitcase and a backpack.   
I had been obsessed by [Minimalism][0] and [Early Retirement][1] for the better part of the 2 years before.  
It just seemed like the natural course of action.  

Up until around September 2014 I still owned basically nothing.  
In the intervening 2 years I had picked up just a dining table, a bike, and $20-on-craigslist junk drawer.  
When, on my therapists advice, I moved out of my 280Sq.Ft. studio into a sprawling 2 bedroom I felt instantly better.  
My mental health was totally worth the extra $500/month in rent;   
It felt like the home I had been missing since moving out of my parent's in 2008.  

Next my therapist encouraged me to relax and spend freely for a little while to see what it felt like.  

It felt good! I owned things!  
Like a bed and a drumset and a cat and silverware and a TV and speakers and a computer!   
I could cook!   
I could relax!   
I could sleep!   
I could be creative!  
I could have sex in my own apartment!  

Then I met a girl.   
As young people in love are wont to do we moved way too fast.  
Before I knew it, I was engaged and living with her.  
Just as quickly she became my ex-fiance and I was struggling to find a place to live.

I'm really bad at sharing walls with people.  
Just now, it's 1am and I'm up listening to avant-garde metal with my subwoofer rumbling away happily.  
In the mornings, making a cup of coffee involves 15 minutes of noisily grinding, steaming, and blasting NPR.  
I have a drumset...  

In the past, when I've had roommates or close neighbors I didn't realize the mental toll it took on me.  
Because, despite how loud I am now, I'm incredibly conscious about noise and disrupting others.  
Constantly tip-toeing around, policing the volume of everything from Crunchyroll to cooking to sex.  
Honestly, I probably belong in a Suburban house tucked away on some quiet col-de-sac.  
Or at least, if I didn't detest cars and suburbs and national mega-corp chains...

My basic housing requirements are:  

- A standalone building
- Within walking distance of a grocery store
- Near reasonable transit

Which, is actually kind of hard to find in Chicago.  
Especially on short notice like I had in August of 2015.  

I finally found a Coach House for $1750/month.  
Waaaay more than I would have liked to spend, but I was becoming a "proper adult" and it was under 30% of my income.  
Also, there was the whole _living with my ex_ thing that influenced me to take the first place I could find.  

So I've been here for a year.  
After living in 11 different places since 2008, rarely for more than 6 months at a time, I was ready for a place to call home.  
Or at least, until I sat down and started actually budgeting again after a 2 year free-for-all. 

I set aside a not unreasonable 45% of income for retirement and a down payment each month.  
After subtracting rent and bills from what was left, I was left with ~$40/month for wine and cat toys and cute dresses.  
Which really, all that would lead to is 

1. "Overspending" my meager allowance
1. Feeling bad about it
1. Spending more on comfort things because I feel bad
1. Feeling bad about it
1. ...

My bills aren't actually that much a month.   
Google Fi, no car, no air conditioning, no student loans.  
By far the biggest expense was housing; fortunately, my lease was almost up.  

**...**

So I started writing this post with the intention to go into more technical detail about Mithril.js.  
That was 4 weeks ago...  

This sort of non-technical and semi-relevant expository portion ballooned out of control.  
Since then I've already found a place and moved in.  
This post almost feels like the last piece of cruft left over after a vigorous purging of possessions.  
My experience apartment hunting and the tool I hacked together to assist can probably waite..
