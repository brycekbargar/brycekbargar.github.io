Impedence mismatch with Squarespace

- Text editing in a browser is awful. (even with wasavi...)
- I have saving local files
- Drafts got lost, never started

Black boxi-ness

- Configuration over convention is wrong
- Leaky abstractions and too many abstractions
- Looks "too" professional

Other Considerations

- $$$
- SSL
- Not actually learning anything (have time now)


Jekyll

1. Get the content in
1. Actually design the layout
1. Strip out everything and only write what is needed
1. Over time add more and more
 
Dotfiles are an area where I've actually seen this in action

- Start out with nothing
- Just implement the bare mininum
- Be happy with it (Important step!)
- Go back (after a year!) and laugh at how bad some of it was
- Clean up and then add on top and be proud again
