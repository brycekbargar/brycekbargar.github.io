So there is a thing that exists called [Extreme Programming][1].  
It has a tenet, [Refactor Mercilessly][2]. 

>"We computer programmers hold onto our software designs long after they have become unwieldy. We continue to use and reuse code that is no longer maintainable because it still works in some way and we are afraid to modify it."

You can see where this is going...
