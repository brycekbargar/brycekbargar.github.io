summary: Learning to do what I enjoy and make surprising connections while doing it

I changed my name legally in April of 2016.
One of the best side effects was updating my Library Card and feeling comfortable picking up reading as a hobby again.

At the beginning, like with most habits, it was slow-going.
Maybe a book every couple of weeks at first, but now I'm up to ~500 pages a week.

One of the biggest hurdles was not feeling pressured to 
1. Read "smart people" books, i.e. non-fiction, academic, gender studies, hard science, sociology
1. "Study" the material I was reading

It felt like if I wasn't taking notes or doing some sort of in-depth synthesis of what I was reading I was just being a "consumer" of content.

Turns out that I like... just _reading_.

So I've increasing the amount of Science Fiction I check out and at the same time stopped worrying about extracting every little detail from every piece of text.
Sometimes books are just books and stories are just stories and it's ok to just consume them.

This has had... unexpected results.

Immediately after finishing Kim Stanley Robinson's "Mars" trilogy I dove in to Liu's Cixin's "Remembrance of Earth's Past" trilogy, 
all the while working through Octavia Butler's "Lilith's Brood" collection as they become available.

Living in these diverse, fictional, and future worlds concurrently has been giving some amazing context and pairing to the random non-fiction books I've picked up.

Taking part in the history of the Trisolarians struggle to maintain a level of technological progress while dealing with a rapidly oscillating population count is amazingly echoed in the story of the Tasmaninan's isolation and subsequent regression which provide the backbone for the thesis of "Rational Optimist" by Matt Ridley. 
Technology is the result of the mating of ideas, and having a sufficient number of brains is necessary for the network effect to take hold in a population.
Earth, not being bound by the constraints of the incalculable three-body sun system has this network effect.
The Trisolarians only have this network effect in short spurts, and many societies and their associated advances get wiped clean by planetary ruin.

Kim Stanley Robinson's ideas regarding the post-scarcity utopia of Martian society are a hilarious (and sad) counterpoint to not just the overpopulated Earth presented in the trilogy but also the World3 modeled Earth presented in "Limits to Growth: The 30 Year Update". 
Reading about a modeled world that prioritizes growing pollution sinks, shrinking resource consumption, and saying "everyone can have 'enough'" is one thing, seeing an actual pseudo-implementation and 1800 page exploration of the concepts is completely different.

Sometimes though, two authors can hold completely opposing viewpoints. (shocker, i know...)
A semi-central point of "American Mania" is that the internet, and to a larger extent the anonymization of markets, leads to vapid overconsumption and a breakdown in long-term trust.
In "The Rational Optimist" the author holds the internet and product reviews as an example of growing social trust.
If I were to have taken time to read and thoroughly study each individual text would this contradiction have been any more apparent to me?
Is it because I've moved so quickly from title to title that I can make this connection, and identify examples of both viewpoints in the world that was painstaking built in "Dawn" to be free of eurocentrism and patriarchy, then so quickly torn down in "Adulthood Rites" by humans being humans?
Should I now sit and  meditate on this contradiction? Hold an internal debate with myself and argue for or against each theory, drawing on my own world view to help resolve the tension?
I  would do well to remember there is actually a grey area and that just because I "discovered" one theory "first" does not mean that the contradictory theory is immediately "wrong".

> To me currently, the best course of action is to explore this grey area by exposing myself to as many diverse world views as possible, expressed as works of fiction, while keeping in mind these contradictions, identified and expounded upon in works of non-fiction.

In the end... Science fiction _is_ Fiction.
The worlds built up so lovingly by authors can be great tools for empathizing with our society and the challenges we're facing present day and in the near (and highly speculative) future.
It would be a dangerous form of escapism to "live" these fantasy worlds for too long, which is why I've grown to love mixing in non-fiction books as a way to remain grounded in reality and shape the lens through which I visit them.
